                I suppose that one might say that my story begins in
                Indianapolis, Indiana. That&apos;s where I was born after all. I
                daresay that isn&apos;t where it started, though. It started
                more fully in Fishers, what was, at the time, a smaller town to
                the Northeast. It&apos;s now a city but that&apos;s besides the
                point. There I was in elementary school until fourth grade. The
                most memorable thing for me during this period is one particular
                teach: Mr. Heiden. I apologize if you are reading this, Mr.
                Heiden, and I misspelled your name. Nonetheless, he was a cool
                guy. He travelled a lot and I credit him with first exposing me
                to different cultures. He even introduced them to our classroom,
                having us sit on the floor with lowered desks rather than
                standard seating. It was a good time, and a fond memory of mine.
